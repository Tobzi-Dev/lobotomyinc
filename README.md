## Config

`{
  "lobotomize_villagers_enabled": true,
  "lobotomy_names": []
}`

Write name like this ["name1", "name2" ...]


## How it works

Optimised villager have their pathfinding fully disabled so it's best to use mod for tradehalls while having villager near job block. Their brain is turned off until trades need to be restock.
